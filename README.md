# ⚡ Eternal Architects

## Introduction
Eternal Architects is a startup developing a **software system** that helps customers optimize their electricity usage. Our solution combines a **mobile app** and **web interface** with a **hardware device** that enables:

- Monitoring of smart devices in households  
- Collecting data on electricity consumption and production habits  
- Providing personalized electricity usage recommendations  
- Automated smart device control to optimize consumption  

We primarily target **single detached homes** and **housing companies**, with deployment at scale — one instance per household, supporting multiple users.

## 👩‍💻 Our Team
We are a group of **computer science experts** with diverse specializations. As a startup, our focus is on:

- Leveraging modern technologies  
- Rapid and efficient scaling  
- Building a path toward high profitability  

To achieve scalability, our solution must be **easily adoptable** by users with varying levels of technical knowledge. At the same time, we face **near-term cost pressures** due to limited funding.

## 🔑 High-Level Solution
Our system is built around three main components:

1. **Data Gathering** – Understanding electricity consumption patterns  
2. **Optimization** – Using data to reduce consumption and costs  
3. **Smart System Integration** – Providing recommendations and automation  

The main complexity lies in **integrating diverse smart appliances**. We are actively exploring **existing standards and standardization drives** in the smart home and energy sectors.

## ⚙️ Challenges
While conceptually simple, execution involves significant complexity:

- **Reliability is critical**: failures could lead to suboptimal consumption and higher costs  
- **No baseline architecture**: freedom to explore novel technologies and designs  
- **Highly regulated energy markets**: external context is stable but compliance is essential  

---

## 🔒 Data & Security
Data will be managed by us to avoid the need for private household servers. This requires:

- Robust **data protection** and **security measures**  
- Full **compliance with regulations and standards** in the energy sector  

---

## 🎯 Summary
Our project aims to deliver a **scalable, innovative solution** that optimizes electricity consumption costs for consumers. By addressing:

- Smart-appliance integration  
- System reliability  
- A clear business model  

Eternal Architects is positioned for success in a **highly regulated and standardized market**.
