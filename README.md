Introduction
Our startup, Eternal Architects, is developing a software system to help customers
optimize their electricity by using a mobile app or a web page to view information and
control smart devices. Our proposed solution is a hardware device that allows users
to monitor smart devices in their household, collect data on electricity consumption
and production habits, and provide electricity usage recommendations and
automated smart device control to optimise electricity usage. We are mainly targeting
single detached homes and housing companies. The solution is intended to be
deployed at a large scale, with one instance per household. One instance may
support multiple users.
Our team consists of computer science experts with diverse specializations. As a
startup, we aim to leverage modern technologies and achieve a potential for high
profitability in the future, by focusing on rapid and efficient scaling. For scalability, the
solution needs to be easily adoptable by users, catering to consumers with varying
levels of technical knowledge. We are also facing certain near term cost pressures
due to our limited funding.
The high-level solution involves three main parts: gathering data to understand
electricity consumption, using this data to optimize consumption, and interfacing with
smart systems to provide usage recommendations and possible automation. The
main complexity will doubtlessly lie in how to integrate various smart appliances, and
we need to explore existing standards and standardization drives in the smart home
and energy sectors (if there are any).
The software project, while conceptually simple, involves significant complexity in
execution. The system's reliability is critical, as any failure could lead to suboptimal
electricity consumption and higher costs for consumers. With no existing baseline
architecture, and no relevant organisational praxis, we are free to explore novel
technologies and designs. On the other hand the electrical energy markets are highly
standardized and heavily regulated, so we do not expect significant changes in the
external context.
Data will most likely be managed by us, since households would otherwise need
some form of private server to manage the data, and this requires robust data
protection and security measures. Additionally, we must ensure compliance with
relevant regulations and standards in the electrical energy sector.
In summary, our project aims to create a scalable, innovative solution that optimizes
electricity consumption costs for consumers. By addressing the complexities of
smart-appliance integration, ensuring reliability, and defining a clear business model,
we can position our startup for success in this highly regulated and standardized
market.
